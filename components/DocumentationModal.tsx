                        <P>This is a powerful data safety feature. <Strong>Backup All Data</Strong> creates a single <CodeBlock>.zip</CodeBlock> file containing ALL projects currently in the application. <Strong>Restore from Backup</Strong> will completely overwrite all existing application data with the contents of the backup file. This is useful for migrating your work to a new computer.</P>

                        <P>This is your primary safety net against data loss. From the main menu, you can configure auto-backup by selecting a folder on your computer. As you work, the application will periodically and automatically save a full backup file (<CodeBlock>kastle-wizard-autosave.zip</CodeBlock>) to that location.</P>
